# Campaign Analysis

This project contains a script for performing basic ETL on a marketing campaign data file from Bradesco's BI Analyst II Challenge.

## Setup

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment (if not yet created):
     ```
     python -m venv venv

     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```
       .\env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```
       source env/bin/activate
       ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Use the following command to install the necessary packages from `requirements.txt`:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Run the Script

Once the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed, run the script with:

cd 1.scripts 
python campaign_analysis.py
